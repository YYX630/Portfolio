# Self Introduction

## Hi
I'm a college student at the University of Tokyo's department of ICT, majoring in electrical engineering and computer science.

I've spent my childhood in China and my youth in Japan, and the drastic changes technology brought to our lives and society that I witnessed had a great impact on my motivation.
